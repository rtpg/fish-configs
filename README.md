Fish config
-------------

This repo contains modifications to my `fish` shell


How to use
-----------
Simply clone this repo into your `~/.config/fish`.

While not necessary, it's strongly recommended to use `fish` as your default shell, considering how amazing it is.

List of additions
-----------------

- An `rvm` function that wraps `rvm` (You still need to install RVM)[Info here](http://rvm.io/integration/fish)

- When in a git repository, the prompt will show the name of the branch you're in, and will be red when the folder is dirty, orange when there are untracked changes
